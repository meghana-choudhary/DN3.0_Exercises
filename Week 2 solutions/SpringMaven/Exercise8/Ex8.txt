Added methods for logging before and after the execution of service methods using the @Before and @After annotations. A logger instance is created for logging messages. The pointcut expression matches the execution of any method in any class within the com.library.service package intercepted respectively at the Before and After advice. This provides simple logging functionality to monitor the execution of methods withing a specified package.
