Annotation based configuration allows for configuring the components without defining each individual bean. Added a context tag in the applicationContext.java file with base package as "com.library" which allows for scanning all the components within it. Added annotation @Service and @Repository in the BookService and BookRepository class respectively. Also added a @Autowire annotation in the BookService class to inject the dependency of a bean within a bean. The application is run and outputs achieved as desired.Thus annotation based configurations makes code easier to maintain and makes it more readable which is a desirable feature of any application source code.
