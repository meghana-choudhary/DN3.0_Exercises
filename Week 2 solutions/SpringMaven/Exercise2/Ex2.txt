Updated the applicationContext.xml to wire BookRepository into Book Service. Created an class instance of BookRepository within BookService and added a setter method. Then in the xml file added a property tag within the bean of BookService with the name same as the variable defined in the BookService class and referenced it to the bean of the variable which in our case in bookRepository. Run the App.java file to obtain the outputs of the two classes only through the BookService class. So successfully performed dependency injection.
