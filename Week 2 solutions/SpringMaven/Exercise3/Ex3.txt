To enable Aspect support added the aop autoproxy tag within the applicationContext.xml file. Add necessary dependencies within the pom.xml file. Created a new package in the main directory named aspect and added a class LoggingAspect. Defined its bean in the applicationContext.xml file. In the LoggingAspect class added an Around method to intercept the BookService methods proving us full control of the method throughout its execution time. The proceedingJoinPoint parameter is passed in the method. In the advice, proceed() is called on the ProceedingJoinPoint to invoke the actual method. The execution time is calculated by subtracting the end time from the start time.This also allows us to provide custom dvices before or after the actual method execution. The output logs the method start time , end time and total time required for its execution.
