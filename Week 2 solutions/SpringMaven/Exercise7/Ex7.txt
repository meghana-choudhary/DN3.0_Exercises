Updated the applicationContext.xml file by adding a constructor-arg tag within the bookService bean referencing to the bookRepository bean. Added a constructor in the the bookService class. Ran the App.java to show both outputs of setter and constructor indication success of setter injection and constructor injection. The main difference between the  constructor and setter is that constructor is called automatically during the time of object creation unlike the setter method with is need to be called explicitly. Constructor injection is very useful for injecting mandatory dependencies which is to be loaded at the time of object creation initially. Setter injections are however useful for optional dependencies.
